# casbin.js

Casbin.js is the front-end port from [Node-Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin) in Node.js. Most of their code is shared.

Casbin.js has been already used in [Casbin Online Editor](https://casbin.org/en/editor) for front-end enforcement, by [this commit](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website/commit/ee916d5891eef18bb743c97299b263a036bb6a47).

We have plan to extract it into this repo, still work in progress. For now, you can just use the logic in Casbin Online Editor.
